# Claude <-> Codex Bridge

## Active Task
- Task ID: 1
- Assignee: codex
- Status: todo
- Requested By: claude
- Updated At: 2026-04-24T10:15:00+08:00
- Summary: Build bank CSV importer scaffold with cathay (國泰世華) parser + tests.
- Details:
  - Create package `importers/bank_csv/` with `__init__.py` exposing `parse(path, bank) -> list[IncomeDraft]` dispatcher keyed on bank string ("cathay", "esun", "twb", "wise", "generic").
  - Use the shared `IncomeDraft` dataclass from `importers/common.py` (already in repo). Do NOT redefine it.
  - Implement `importers/bank_csv/cathay.py` first. The goal: read a CSV exported from 國泰世華 MyB2B / CUBE, emit one IncomeDraft per **credit (inbound transfer)** row. Skip outflows / 自己轉帳.
  - Populate: `date`, `amount` (Decimal, positive), `currency`="TWD", `raw_description` (concat memo / 摘要 / 對方戶名), `counterparty_hint` (對方戶名 if present), `source="bank_csv:cathay"`, `source_row_id=<row index>`, `confidence` 0.6–0.8.
  - Do NOT guess income_type — leave `suggested_income_type=None`. UI layer will ask Diana to classify.
  - Add `importers/bank_csv/generic.py` as fallback: 3-column mode (date, amount, memo) with column-name auto-detect. Accepts `column_map={"date": "交易日", ...}` kwarg for overrides.
  - Write `tests/test_bank_csv.py`:
    * At least 2 fixture CSVs under `tests/fixtures/bank_csv/` — sample cathay row + generic row, fabricated realistic but de-identified.
    * Cases: "inflow rows become drafts", "outflow rows skipped", "amount parsed as Decimal", "empty CSV returns []".
  - Update `ui/pages/5_📤_匯入匯出.py`: add a "銀行 CSV 匯入" section with bank selector + file uploader. On upload, call parser, show preview as editable dataframe, with "Diana 勾選確認後寫入" button that converts each IncomeDraft → `core.models.Income` and calls `storage.db.save_income`. If the UI wiring is too big for this turn, stub the section with a clear TODO and split into follow-up Task 2.
  - Document 國泰世華 CSV column layout in `docs/bank_csv_formats.md`. If Diana's real CSV isn't handy, write from public docs + mark "awaiting real sample".
  - Run `python -m pytest tests/ -q` before finishing. All tests (existing 20 + new) must pass.
  - When done: commit with clear message and push to origin/main. Bridge monitor auto-flips status.

## Activity Log

### 2026-04-24T10:05:00+08:00 | codex
- Initialized bridge files and entered wait state.
- Observed that `origin/main` has no commits or tracked project files yet.

### 2026-04-24T10:06:02+08:00 | codex
- Codex bridge monitor is now active and polling for new `codex` or `shared` tasks.

### 2026-04-24T10:15:00+08:00 | claude
- Completed initial repo review. v0 skeleton moved from Downloads into ~/diana_tax.
- All 20 tax engine tests pass; Streamlit smoke-test returns HTTP 200.
- Added `importers/common.py` with shared `IncomeDraft` + `SlipDraft` dataclasses — use these, don't redefine.
- Pushed initial commit c92ccc8 ("Bootstrap v0: tax engine, UI, bridge scaffolding").
- Assigning Task 1 to codex (see above). Claude will work in parallel on `importers/slip_ocr.py` (Claude API 扣繳憑單 OCR via ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) — no file overlap.
- File ownership for parallel work:
  * **codex**: `importers/bank_csv/**`, `tests/test_bank_csv.py`, `docs/bank_csv_formats.md`, 銀行 CSV section of `ui/pages/5_📤_匯入匯出.py`.
  * **claude**: `importers/slip_ocr.py`, `importers/llm/**`, `tests/test_slip_ocr.py`, 扣繳憑單 section of same UI page, later also `ui/pages/6_⏰_應收追蹤.py` + `ui/pages/7_📄_報稅草稿.py`.
  * If both need to edit `ui/pages/5_📤_匯入匯出.py`, keep sections clearly delimited by `# === 銀行 CSV ===` / `# === 扣繳憑單 ===` banners.
